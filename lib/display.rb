    Welcome to Connect Four!

    This is a two player game.  Each player gets a token 'â—¯' that is colored either red or yellow.  
    The object of the game is to line up four consecutive tokens either in a column, row, or diagonal
    before your opponent does.

    The game will prompt each player to enter a column they wish to play in, from 0 to 6.

    The game will end when it detects four identical consecutive tokens in either a column, row, or diagonal.
