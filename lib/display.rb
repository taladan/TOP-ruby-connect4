      Welcome to Connect Four!

      This is a two player game.  Each player gets a token 'â—¯' that is colored either red or yellow.
      The object of the game is to line up four consecutive tokens either in a column, row, or diagonal
      before your opponent does.

      The game will prompt each player to enter a column they wish to play in, from 0 to 6.

      The game will end when it detects four identical consecutive tokens in either a column, row, or diagonal.

  def game_end(player1, player2, winner)
    victor = player1 if winner == player1.token
    victor = player2 if winner == player2.token
    puts <<~GAMEEND

      GAME OVER

      #{victor.name} wins!
